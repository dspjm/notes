Relevant Project Experience:

1.
Name:        System Storage Manager test suite development.
Date:        2013/05 -- 2013/07
Environment: Linux, bash, ssm, lvm, btrfs, device-mapper
Description: System Storage Manager is a storage management tool for RHEL,
  it's an important new feature of RHEL7. It simplifies management of lvm,
  btrfs and other volume backends. I did the basic functionality tests, write
  test plan and develop our own test suite for the software. Reported many bugs
  about the software and find some bugs of btrfs. Some patches were merged into
  the upstream project. And my work earned the appreciation of my leader and
  developper.
  You can learn about the project http://storagemanager.sourceforge.net/ and see
  my patches at the mailing list of the project.

2.
Name:        Tests for Linux kernel filesystem

Environment: Linux, kernel, kbuild, C
Description: Creates a char device, user can access firmware descriptors and
  settings, retrieve packages sent by the mouse and choose different functions
  of the mouse if supported by the device, through the char device.  You can see
  the source code at https://github.com/dspjm/earlymodules as well as some
  modules I have written
